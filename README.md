## OCR copy and paste

I found this little script useful for me particularly when dealing in video sharing calls where some text needed to be shared but neither I nor the person sharing could copy the text required.

*particularly useful when copying sensitive data* that later needs to be pasted somewhere safe, and not having to use a separate channel to share it (or secret sharing service).

### Requirements
```
brew install tesseract
brew install pngpaste
```

### Installation
```
curl https://github.com/marcusbb/tessocr/blob/master/tsocr.sh -O /usr/local/bin/tessocr.sh
```

### Usage
